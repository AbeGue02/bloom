# ðŸŒ³ Bloom Habit Tracker

Bloom is a habit tracking app that allows for users to track habits while they grow a plant (exclusively virtually for now). The app comes with an scoring system that rewards users after they complete all the habits they set for themselves in a specific day. For example, if I have three habits, only after I complete those three habits, I will get points to make my plant grow (Which is determined by an emoji inside of the profile screen).
